# Pyreframe

Pyreframe is a 3D engine made using Python. As such, it's very slow! Points, lines and polygons can be generated, and are dynamically lit. 

## Usage

Import classes from engine.py, and add light sources and objects as shown in main.py.

## Prerequisites

In its current incarnation, Pyreframe requires the Pygame library in order to display images on the screen, but it is designed to make using a different renderer easy. See the Renderer() class in engine.py for this.
