# Pyreframe

Pyreframe is a rudimentary 3D engine made using Python. As such, it's very slow!

# Usage

Import classes from engine.py, and add light sources and objects as shown in demo.py. In its current incarnation, Pyreframe requires the Pygame library to display images to a screen, but it is designed to make using a different renderer easy. See the Renderer() class in engine.py for this.
